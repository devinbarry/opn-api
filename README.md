# OPN API

This library is a fork of opn-cli by Andreas St√ºrz (https://github.com/andreas-stuerz/opn-cli).

I have stipped most of his code out and kept on the API implementation. It has been expanded to support as many API
functions as possible. The reason I chose his project to fork from the three other OPNSense API projects I could find
was because the way he designed the API classes to be expandable to any of the possible API calls is great.
Its super easy to add any other API functions that you might need.
