# OPN API

A Python client for the OPNSense API.

This library is based on [opn-cli](https://github.com/andreas-stuerz/opn-cli) (v1.7.0) by Andreas St√ºrz, with additional code from [python-opnsense](https://github.com/turnbros/python-opnsense) by Dylan Turnbull.

Most non-essential code from opn-cli has been removed, focusing solely on API implementation. The design makes it easy to expand and add new API functions as needed, ensuring broad support for OPNSense API calls.
